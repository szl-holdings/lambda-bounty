  HONEST POSTURE
  --------------
  Λ (the 9-axis geometric-mean trust aggregator) remains **Conjecture 1**. It is
  NOT a theorem. This file states the conjecture as a `theorem ... := by sorry`
  so that a bounty submission may DISCHARGE the `sorry` without adding any axiom
  beyond the published allowlist (see Allowed_Axioms.lean).

  The statement below mirrors `f23_lambda_aggregator_sound : Prop := sorry` from
  lutar-lean/Lutar/Puriq/Formulas/PuriqFormulaLean.lean, made concrete enough to
  prove: Λ is the UNIQUE aggregator (up to the stated equivalence) satisfying the
  four axioms A1–A4 under the agentic composition operator.

  Quechua/heritage names elsewhere are brand naming. No mystical claims.

/-- **A4 — Zero-absorption (weakest-link).** If any axis is 0, the aggregate is 0.
    This is the geometric-mean signature: one fully-failed axis vetoes trust. -/

**CONJECTURE 1 — Λ-Aggregator Uniqueness.**

Any two aggregators that satisfy A1–A4 agree on every input — i.e. the axioms
pin down the aggregator uniquely (the geometric-mean aggregator Λ is the unique
fixed point of A1–A4 under the agentic composition operator).

NOTE: This is the bounty target. It is stated with `sorry` and is **NOT** a
theorem until a submission discharges the `sorry` using ONLY the allowlisted
axioms (Allowed_Axioms.lean). Do not remove the `sorry` without a real proof.

HONEST SOUNDNESS CAVEAT (do NOT delete — this is the flagship honesty example).
As stated, A1–A4 ALONE do not single out the geometric mean: `min` satisfies all
four (min of a constant vector is that constant; monotone; permutation-invariant;
any 0 input forces 0) yet `min ≠ geometric mean`. So a fully general proof of
this exact statement is impossible — the conjecture in this literal form is
refuted by the `min` counterexample (Aczél 1966; Kolmogorov–Nagumo–de Finetti
1930–31; t-norm theory: `min` is the unique idempotent t-norm). A *provable*
uniqueness theorem additionally needs continuity + bisymmetry/associativity +
homogeneity (or multiplicativity), after which the n-D Cauchy step (`CAUCHY_ND`)
closes. Tightening the axiom set (e.g. adding `A5_Bisymmetric`, `A6_Continuous`,
`A7_Homogeneous`) is a FOUNDER decision; until then the bounty stands as an
honest open problem under public axiom audit, and `main` legitimately stays red.
